_Create a custom running training calendar leading up to your race day_

<http://therunup.org/>

Just pick your race date and a training plan.

Click the button to show your plan in a calendar view with the real dates leading up to your race.

## Running schedule sources

I am not a doctor, trainer or sports expert. I am a web developer that runs and wanted a nicer training schedule planner. I did not make these training schedules, but collected them from various sources listed below. Always talk to your doctor or a trained professional when significantly altering your diet, exercise, behavior, etc.

* [Hal Higdon Marathon Training](http://www.halhigdon.com/)
* [MarathonRookie.com](http://www.marathonrookie.com/)
* [Cool Running](http://www.coolrunning.com/)

## To do

* pull in dates of upcoming big races to select from?

## About

This is a simple tool, built quickly to demonstrate a specific idea I had. It's not meant to solve all problems for everyone, but I am happy to share it as a reference or starting point for similar applications.
