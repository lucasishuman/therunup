Just pick your race date and a training plan.

Click the button to show your plan in a calendar view with the real dates leading up to your race.

## Running schedule sources

I am not a doctor, trainer or sports expert. I am a web developer that runs and wanted a nicer training schedule planner. I did not make these training schedules, but collected them from various sources listed below. Always talk to your doctor or a trained professional when significantly altering your diet, exercise, behavior, etc.

## About

This is a simple tool, built quickly to solve a specific need I had. It's not meant to solve all problems for everyone, but I am happy to share it as a reference or starting point for similar applications.
